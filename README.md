This mini project has helped me get started using Svelte.
I'm preparing for a Data visualization Hackathon where l will be using Svelte, so this has been a great project to introduce me to svelte

### What l learned

- Svelte project structure
- Deleting and adding elements to the DOM
- The use of Stores to store and retreive data

- Utilizing native svelte animations

This was a very insightful crash course from TraversyMedia
